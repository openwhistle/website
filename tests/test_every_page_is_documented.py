"""Every page of the interface is documented on some docs page (the built pages).

The list of pages comes from the routes of the latest app release (scripts/release_source.py
parses app/api/*.py), not from a list somebody has to extend: every GET route is either a
page — and then the docs must name it — or it is in ``NOT_A_PAGE`` by exact path, with the
reason. A new route cannot
slip through by happening to look like an exclusion, and an exclusion whose
route is gone fails too.

The matching rule: the docs pages (entities decoded) must contain the route path
bounded on both sides by a character that cannot be part of a path, so
``/admin/reports/{report_id}`` is not satisfied by
``/admin/reports/{id}/export.pdf``. Each ``{param}`` in the route matches any
placeholder the docs use for it: ``{id}``, ``{report_id}``, ``<slug>``. A
full URL (``https://host/admin/oidc/callback``) does not count: it is a
configuration example, not a description of the page.
